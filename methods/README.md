# Digital-Forest-Monitoring

### Forest monitoring remote sensing methods.

## Data sources

* Sentinel-2 satellite imagery provided by the [ESA](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2)
* Forest mask based [swisstopo TLM](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/wissen-fakten/topografisches-landschaftsmodell.html)

## Methods

### Use-Case 1

Annual forest change maps based on NDVI greenest pixel composites.

### Use-Case 2

Near real-time damage indication maps for natural disturbances based on fully pre-processed NBR difference maps for a specific time range.
